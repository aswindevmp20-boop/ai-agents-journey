Oceans cover more than seventy percent of the Earth’s surface and are essential to life on the planet.
They play a major role in regulating global climate by absorbing large amounts of heat and carbon dioxide.
Ocean currents help distribute heat across different regions, influencing weather patterns worldwide.

Marine ecosystems are incredibly diverse, ranging from shallow coral reefs to deep-sea trenches.
Millions of species live in the oceans, many of which are still undiscovered.
Fish, plankton, corals, and marine mammals form complex food chains that maintain ecological balance.

However, ocean health is under serious threat.
Overfishing has significantly reduced fish populations in many regions.
Plastic pollution and chemical waste contaminate marine habitats and harm wildlife.
Rising sea temperatures caused by climate change lead to coral bleaching and habitat loss.

Protecting ocean ecosystems requires global cooperation.
Sustainable fishing practices, reduced plastic use, and climate action are critical steps.
Without intervention, the long-term health of the oceans — and life on Earth — is at risk.
