We create two agents:

    1. Planner Agent

        Responsible for:

            Understanding the user question

            Breaking it into steps

            Deciding what needs to be done

        Example output:

            Step 1: Search documents about ocean health threats  
            Step 2: Summarize the threats  
            Step 3: Answer the user clearly

    2. Worker Agent

        Responsible for:

            Executing the plan

            Calling tools (RAG retrieval)

            Producing the final answer

This separation gives:

    Better reasoning

    Clear control flow

    Debuggable logic

    Extendable system (add more agents later)
