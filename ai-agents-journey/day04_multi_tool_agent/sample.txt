Life in the small coastal town moved at a rhythm that felt almost separate from the rest of the world. Each morning, the gulls announced the sunrise long before the first boats drifted out of the harbor, their calls echoing across the water like impatient reminders of the day ahead. Locals wandered the cobblestone streets with a familiarity born from generations living in the same place, exchanging quiet nods or warm greetings as they passed. And though nothing remarkable ever seemed to happen there, the town held a quiet magic—one woven from salty air, worn wooden docks, and stories whispered between waves.
