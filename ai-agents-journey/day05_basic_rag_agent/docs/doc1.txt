Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and play a vital role in regulating global climate patterns. 
They absorb a large portion of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere and distribute heat around the planet. 
Marine ecosystems are home to millions of species, many of which are still undiscovered. 
Overfishing, pollution, and rising sea temperatures pose major threats to ocean health.
