What is Conversational RAG?

    Instead of:

        User: What are threats to ocean health?
        Agent: answer
        User: Why are they dangerous?
        ❌ Agent forgets what "they" means


    We build:

        User: What are threats to ocean health?
        Agent: answer
        User: Why are they dangerous?
        ✅ Agent remembers context (threats)


    So now the pipeline becomes:

        Conversation History
                +
        User Query
                ↓
        Hybrid RAG Retrieval
                ↓
        LLM Answer grounded in docs + memory
